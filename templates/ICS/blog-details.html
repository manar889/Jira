            <h2 class="title">What is anxiety?</h2>

            

            <div class="content">
              <p>
                Anxiety is a complex response to real or perceived threats. It can involveTrusted Source cognitive, physical, and behavioral changes.
              </p>

              <p>
                Real or perceived danger causes a rush of adrenaline, a hormone and chemical messenger in the brain, which in turn triggers these anxiety reactions in a process called the fight-or-flight response. Some people may experience this response in difficult social situations or around important events or decisions.
              </p>

              <p>
                The duration or severity of feelings of anxiety can sometimes be out of proportion to the original trigger or stressor. Physical symptoms, such as increased blood pressure and nausea, may also develop. These responses move beyond anxiety into an anxiety disorder.
              </p>

              <p>
                Once anxiety reaches the stage of a disorder, it can interfereTrusted Source with daily function.
              </p>

              <blockquote>
                <p>
                  “A neurosis…is not a disgrace…It is not a fatal disease, but it does grow worse to the degree that one is determined to ignore it.”
                </p>
<p>Carl Jung, Civilization in Transition</p>
                
              </blockquote>
              <h3> Types</h3>
              <p>The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders: 5th Edition, text revision (DSM-5-TR) classifies anxiety disorders into several main types.</p>
<p> Anxiety disorders now include the following:</p>

<h3> GAD</h3>
              <p>
                This chronic disorder involves excessive, long lasting anxiety and worries about nonspecific life events, objects, and situations. GAD is the most common anxiety disorder, and people with it are not always able to identify the cause of their anxiety.</p>

              <h3>Panic disorder              </h3>
              <p>
                Brief or sudden attacks of intense terror and apprehension characterize panic disorder. These attacks can lead to shaking, confusion, dizziness, nausea, and breathing difficulties. Panic attacks tend to occur and escalate rapidly.
              </p>
          

              <h3>Specific phobia              </h3>
              <p>
                This is a fear and avoidance of a particular object or situation. Phobias are not like other anxiety disorders, as they relate to a specific causeTrusted Source.
              </p>
              <p>
                A person with a phobia might acknowledge fear as illogical or extreme but remain unable to control feelings of anxiety around the trigger. Triggers for a phobia range from situations and animals to everyday objects.
              </p>

              <h3>Agoraphobia              </h3>
              <p>
                This is a fear and avoidance of places, events, or situations from which it may be difficult to escape or where help would not be available in emergencies.
               </p>
              <p>
                People often misunderstand this condition as a phobia of open spaces and the outdoors. A person with agoraphobia may fear leaving home or using elevators and public transport.
               </p>
               <h3>Selective mutism              </h3>
              <p>
                Some children experience this form of anxiety, in which they cannot speak in certain places or contexts, even though they may have excellent verbal communication skills around familiar people.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Social anxiety disorder              </h3>
              <p>
                This is a fear of adverse judgment from others in social situations or of public embarrassment. Social anxiety disorder includes a range of feelingsTrusted Source, such as stage fright, a fear of intimacy, and anxiety around humiliation and rejection.
               </p>

               <h3>Separation anxiety disorder              </h3>
               <p>
                High anxiety levels after separation from a person or place that provides feelings of security or safety characterize separation anxiety disorder. Separation anxiety is most commonTrusted Source in young children but can affect people of all ages. </p>
